## Summarizer model

Summarizer developed is an Extractive text summarizer. Extractive text summarization involves the selection of phrases and sentences from the source document to make up the new summary. Techniques involve ranking the relevance of phrases in order to choose only those most relevant to the meaning of the source.
The algorithm uses a number of features to score the relevance of a sentence:

* TF IDF: is a numerical statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a
 collection or corpus. The tfâ€“idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word.
* Similarity to headline
* Position of the sentence in the article: This assumes that sentences in the starting and in the
 ending are more important
* Length of the sentence

All of these are weighted to produce a single score for each sentence in the article and the most important sentences are picked to form the summary.
