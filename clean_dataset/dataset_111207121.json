The issue seems to be that while other services, like Google News, send readers to publishers\u2019 websites, Apple News generally keeps readers in the app. Or, as NYT puts it, Apple\u2019s approach does not align with The Times\u2019 goal of building direct relationships with paying readers.\r\n\r\n\u201CCore to a healthy model between The Times and the platforms is a direct path for sending those readers back into our environments, where we control the presentation of our report, the relationships with our readers, and the nature of our business rules,\u201D Meredith Kopit Levien, The Times\u2019 chief operating officer, wrote in a memo to employees. \u201COur relationship with Apple News does not fit within these parameters.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Times is one of the first media organizations to leave Apple News, and it was never a part of Apple\u2019s paid subscription service Apple News+, which had a hard time recruiting some of the larger publishers. But the tension between tech companies and news publishers is nothing new.\r\n\r\nIn a statement shared by The NYT, an Apple spokesperson said that Apple News is \u201Ccommitted to supporting quality journalism through the proven business models of advertising, subscriptions, and commerce.\u201D",
